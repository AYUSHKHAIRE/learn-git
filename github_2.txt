two developers or two features can be developed independemtly
in the branches , to moniter reverts and avoid some conflicts .
i can merge some others commit for my code in a single commit

make a new branch 
git checkout -b "branchtwo"

branch made , a feature function new one second functionadded
git push --set-upstream origin branchtwo 
>>>>>>> origin/branchtwo


rebase 
in merge , if we start a branch and then merge after some commits ,
if we merge , we will loose the commit history after merging . 

to avoid this ,
there is a method rebasing
in which we do like we just add the head of new branch to the end of original branch .

but merge is better as for short history 

add and commit in a branch 
git commit -a -m "commit1"
git rebase branch4 [target branch]
